DirectX X Format Exporter for Blender 2.6x

This is the official DirectX X format exporter for Blender.  It is mirrored from Blender's own repository simply for my own portfolio purposes.  It shouldn't be necessary to download this repository, as the script itself ships with the latest versions of Blender.

The most up-to-date versions of the script can be found at <https://git.blender.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi/blender-addons.git/tree/HEAD:/io_scene_x>
and this repository is updated from time to time.  For more information about the script, go to <http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Import-Export/DirectX_Exporter>
